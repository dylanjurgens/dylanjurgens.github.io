    "section": "",
    "text": "In the existence of the National Football League, there have only been two 0-16 teams in its history. Those being the 2008 Detroit Lions and most recently the 2017 Cleveland Browns. Both teams had horrendous seasons, however this question comes to mind. Who was worse? Here lies the answer to that question.\nSo, Sports Reference’s Pro Football Reference website keeps track of every season in the leagues existence. Sports reference has also created a simple rating system, which is labeled as SRS. SRS is a combination of point differential and strength of schedule. Specifically for its pro football website, it has a offensive and defensive simple rating for each team as well.\nNow looking at each season from 2008 to 2023, you can easily say who the worst teams are by just looking at the records from the seasons. However, when you look more closely at each season, you might be surprised at what you find out.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nNFL08_23 &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Documents/SPMC 350 /Project1 Data Files/NFL08_23.csv\")\n\ndetroit &lt;- NFL08_23 |&gt; filter(Team==\"2008 Detroit Lions\")\ndetroit2 &lt;- NFL08_23 |&gt; filter(Team==\"2009 Detroit Lions\")\ncleveland &lt;- NFL08_23 |&gt; filter(Team==\"2017 Cleveland Browns\")\nstlouis &lt;- NFL08_23 |&gt; filter(Team==\"2009 St. Louis Rams\")\ndenver &lt;- NFL08_23 |&gt; filter(Team==\"2013 Denver Broncos\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=NFL08_23, aes(x=OSRS, y=DSRS), color = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=detroit, aes(x=OSRS, y=DSRS), color=\"#0076B6\") +\n  geom_point(data=cleveland, aes(x=OSRS, y=DSRS), color= \"#FF3C00\") +\n  geom_point(data=stlouis, aes(x=OSRS, y=DSRS), color= \"#95774C\") +\n  geom_point(data=denver, aes(x=OSRS, y=DSRS), color= \"#FB4F14\") +\n  geom_point(data=detroit2, aes(x=OSRS, y=DSRS), color=\"#0076B6\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=detroit, aes(x=OSRS, y=DSRS, label=\"2008/09 Lions\"), size=3) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=cleveland, aes(x=OSRS, y=DSRS, label=Team), size=3) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=stlouis, aes(x=OSRS, y=DSRS, label=Team), size=3) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=denver, aes(x=OSRS, y=DSRS, label=Team), size=3) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.000390625, color=\"darkblue\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = -0.002929687, color=\"darkblue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=-7.5, y=7.5, label=\"Good defense, bad offense\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=10, y=-7.5, label=\"Good offense, bad defense\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Offensive simple rating\",\n    y = \"Defensive simple rating\",\n    title = \"Lions have two of the worst defenses and offenses\",\n    subtitle = \"Both 0-16 teams in NFL history were horrible but neither are the worst in both offensive and defensive rating.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro-football-reference.com | By Dylan Jurgens\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2008, the 2009 St. Louis Rams had statistically the worst offensive season preformance according to offensive simple rating. At a horrific -11.7 mark, the next closest was the 2012 Kansas City Chiefs, which had a offensive simple rating of -10.3. You can also see where the 2008 Lions are, and you might also be able to see that the 0-16 Lions had a below average offense but it’s not the worst. However, it was their defense that held them back. Detroit had a -9.1 defensive simple rating in 2008. To add to the sadness, the Lions defense didn’t get any better the year after. In 2009, Detroit bosted a -9.2 defensive simple rating. However, their defense allowed less points in 2009, compared to 2008.\n\n\nCode\nbadteams &lt;- c(\"2008 Detroit Lions\", \"2008 St. Louis Rams\", \"2009 Detroit Lions\", \"2009 St. Louis Rams\", \"2012 Kansas City Chiefs\", \"2020 New York Jets\", \"2010 Carolina Panthers\", \"2011 Tampa Bay Buccaneers\", \"2018 Arizona Cardinals\", \"2017 Cleveland Browns\")\n\nNFL08_23 |&gt;\n  arrange(PD) |&gt;\n  filter(Team %in% badteams) |&gt;\n  select(Team, W, L, T, PD, SRS) |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n    cols_label(\n      Team=\"Team\",\n      W=\"Wins\",\n      L=\"Losses\",\n      T=\"Ties\",\n      PD= \"Point Diff.\",\n      SRS=\"Simple Rating\"\n    ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"2009 St. Louis is worse than 2008 Lions\",\n    subtitle = \"Based off point differential and simple rating, the 2009 Rams are statistically worse than the 0-16 Lions and Browns.
