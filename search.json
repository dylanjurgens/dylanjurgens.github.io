    "section": "",
    "text": "The Nebraska Cornhuskers football team has a storied history. Most of the time, people think of the past when talking about the Huskers’ football legacy that is still stuck in the 90s. Nebraska football uniform history is also pretty storied as well.\nThe Huskers’ alternate uniform history dates back to the 1966 Orange Bowl against the Alabama Crimson Tide. Nebraska decided to go away from their traditional white jersey and red pants look to an all-white look. Yes, this is when the dreaded all-white jersey originated from. The Huskers would go on and lose 33-7 to the Crimson Tide. There are two main types of alternate uniform Nebraska has worn in it’s history. You have the traditional alternate uniform that is a one-time use. The second type is the all-white with the traditional look.\n\nAfter the 1967 Orange Bowl, the Huskers didn’t wear all-white uniforms until the 1991 Citrus Bowl against the No. 2 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. They thought this would be a good idea because it’s been a while since we wore all-white, let’s try it now. Well, things did not go well as the Yellow Jackets demolished the Huskers 45-21.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nUpdated_Alternate_Uniforms &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Documents/SPMC 350 /Project2DataFiles/Updated_Alternate_Uniforms.csv\")\nAlternate &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Documents/SPMC 350 /Project2DataFiles/Alternate.csv\")\n\nUpdated_Alternate_Uniforms |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Uniforms == \"All-White\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(\n    Date, School, Opponent, Pts, Opp\n  ) |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n      Date=\"Date\",\n      School=\"School\",\n      Opponent=\"Opponent\",\n      Pts=\"Points\",\n      Opp= \"Opp Points\"\n    ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Nebraska potentially has an all-white uniform curse\",\n    subtitle = \"The Huskers seem to always lose while wearing all white uniforms against good opponents.

In the first road game of 1992, the Huskers struggle to have any offense against the No. 2 Washington Huskies, losing 14-29 in Seattle. Nebraska then barely got a win over the Missouri Tigers on the road in College Football Hall of Famer Tommie Frazier’s first start, before losing to the 4-7 Iowa State Cyclones. The loss in Ames, Iowa would be head coach Tom Osborne’s only loss to a losing team in his career at Nebraska. The Huskers would not wear all-white again until former head coach Bill Callahan’s final game at Nebraska against the Colorado Buffaloes where Nebraska lost 51-65. Callahan was fired the next day.\n\nThe Huskers worst loss while wearing all-white isn’t even one of those games. The worst loss was in a monumental game against the No. 22 Wisconsin Badgers in Nov. of 2014. If Nebraska went on and defeated the Badgers, the Huskers controlled their destiny for the first ever Big Ten West Division title. The game started off strong for Nebraska. The Huskers held a 17-3 early on in the second quarter. However, this momentum switched quick as the Nebraska defense had no answer for Melvin Gordon, who rushed for a then NCAA record for most rushing yards in a game with 408 yards, while Wisconsin scored 56 unanswered points on the Huskers. Nebraska went on to lose 24-59.\nNow Nebraska has had different jersey modifications, including one-game uniform changes. The first time this occurred was in the 1974 Cotton Bowl against the Texas Longhorns. The Huskers wore white jerseys with red pants, but the thing that was changed was there was a bold “Nebraska” across the top of the jersey. Nebraska went on to win in Tom Osborne’s first bowl game as a coach of the Huskers.\n\nNebraska has worn many different types of alternate uniforms like a Blackshirt uniforms, all black uniforms, all red uniforms, throwback uniforms, etc. Starting in 2009, Adidas and the Huskers started to do an alternate uniform game, which has gone both well and horribly for Nebraska.\n\n\nCode\nAlternate |&gt;\n  select(\n    Date, School, Opponent, Pts, Opp\n  ) |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n      Date=\"Date\",\n      School=\"School\",\n      Opponent=\"Opponent\",\n      Pts=\"Points\",\n      Opp= \"Opp Points\"\n    ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Nebraska's alternate uniform history goes way back\",\n    subtitle =\"The Huskers non-all-white alternate uniform history goes back to 1974.

The Huskers put up 55 points to Louisiana’s 0 points. Nebraska did not wear an alternate uniform again until 2012, where Adidas released alternates for both Nebraska and Wisconsin. Despite being down 17 in the second half, the Huskers came back and defeated the Badgers 30-27. However, things wouldn’t be as nice in 2013.\nNebraska started off the 2013 season with two wins over the Wyoming Cowboys and Southern Mississippi Golden Eagles before facing off with the UCLA Bruins. Adidas and the Huskers announced an alternate uniform with a black jersey with white pants that had black stripes on it for the game. Nebraska started strong against the Bruins held a 21-3 lead over the Bruins in the second quarter before a monumental collapse by the Huskers. UCLA scored 38 unanswered points on Nebraska and the Huskers lost 21-41.\n\nAnother blunder was in September of 2022. It was former head coach Scott Frost’s fifth season at Nebraska and the Huskers were looking at making their first bowl appearance since 2016. The Huskers had a week three matchup against Georgia Southern Eagles. Nebraska wore a 1983 throwback uniform to commemorate the 1983 football team coined as “The Scoring Explosion”. What a way to remember that season with a 42-45 loss to the Eagles, which led to Frost being fired the next day.\n\n\nCode\nupdatedregular &lt;- Updated_Alternate_Uniforms |&gt;\n  filter(Uniforms==\"Regular\") |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    avg_pd = mean(pd)\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Uniforms = \"Regular\"\n  )\n\nupdatedallwhite &lt;- Updated_Alternate_Uniforms |&gt;\n  filter(Uniforms==\"All-White\") |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    avg_pd = mean(pd)\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Uniforms = \"All-White\"\n  )\n\nupdatedalternate &lt;- Updated_Alternate_Uniforms |&gt;\n  filter(Uniforms==\"Alternate\") |&gt;\n  select(Uniforms, pd) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    avg_pd = mean(pd) \n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Uniforms = \"Alternate\"\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=updatedregular, aes(x=Uniforms, weight=avg_pd), fill=\"#E41C38\") +\n  geom_bar(data=updatedallwhite, aes(x=Uniforms, weight=avg_pd), fill=\"#FDF2D9\") +\n  geom_bar(data=updatedalternate, aes(x=Uniforms, weight=avg_pd), fill=\"#000000\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Uniform\",\n    y=\"Average Point Differential\",\n    title=\"Nebraska should stop wearing the all-white uniform\",\n    subtitle=\"The Huskers have a negative average point differential when wearing all-white uniforms.

This shows that Huskers have more success when just wearing the traditional red jersey with white pants at home and wearing a white jersey with red pants on the road. With alternate uniforms, Nebraska has a worse average point differential of just over 2 points while wearing an alternate uniform. Despite all of that, the worst is clearly all-white. When wearing all-white uniforms, the Huskers have an average point differential of under -2. Meaning Nebraska looses more while wearing all-white compared to alternate uniforms and traditional uniforms.\nThis shouldn’t be a surprise though, as it has been discussed among Husker nation that there seems to be a curse when Nebraska wears all-white uniforms, especially in big games (I.e against 2014 Wisconsin).\nThere has only been one Adidas alternate uniform that has been worn twice. This being the blackshirts uniform that the Huskers wore in 2019 against the Indiana Hoosiers and in 2020 against the Illinois Fighting Illini. And oh boy, these uniforms look awesome. However, Nebraska hasn’t won once while wearing these uniforms and haven’t wore the uniforms since then as well.\n\nNebraska had an abysmal performance against the Illini in 2020, where Illinois put up 41 on the Blackshirts. Ironic that the defense didn’t play good when wearing the blackshirts uniform. The Huskers were never in the game after going down 28-10 in the second quarter. What a time that 2020 shorten season was.\n\n\nCode\nThrowbacks &lt;- Updated_Alternate_Uniforms |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Uniforms == \"Throwbacks\"\n  )\n\nBlackshirts &lt;- Updated_Alternate_Uniforms |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Uniforms == \"Blackshirts\"\n  )\n\nall_white &lt;- Updated_Alternate_Uniforms |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Uniforms == \"All-White\"\n  )\n\neverythingelse &lt;- Updated_Alternate_Uniforms |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Uniforms == \"Alternate\"\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=Updated_Alternate_Uniforms, aes(x=Pts, y=Opp), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=Throwbacks, aes(x=Pts, y=Opp), color=\"#E41C38\") +\n  geom_point(data=Blackshirts, aes(x=Pts, y=Opp), color=\"#000000\") +\n  geom_point(data=all_white, aes(x=Pts, y=Opp), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=everythingelse, aes(x=Pts, y=Opp), color=\"darkgreen\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=Throwbacks, aes(x=Pts, y=Opp, label=Opponent), size=2.5) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=Blackshirts, aes(x=Pts, y=Opp, label=Opponent), size=2.5) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=all_white, aes(x=Pts, y=Opp, label=Opponent), size=2.5) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 32.61711  , color=\"darkblue\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 17.9425   , color=\"darkblue\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Team Points\",\n    y = \"Opponent Points\",\n    title = \"Many games did not go well for the Huskers\",\n    subtitle = \"Majority of the Huskers games when they wore a a different uniform than usual are in the top left.

They don’t necessarily have a overall uniform curse but it is possible that they have curse with those all-white uniforms when they wear them in big games. With an overall 5-14 record since the 1966 Orange Bowl when wearing all-white speaks for itself. The Huskers also haven’t won a game with a Blackshirt variant uniform, with a record of 0-5 when doing so. So if there is any takeaway, it would be this: Nebraska should not wear the all-white and blackshirts uniforms."

Here lies the answer to that question.\nSo, Sports Reference’s Pro Football Reference website keeps track of every season in the league’s existence.

Specifically for its pro football website, it has an offensive and defensive simple rating for each team as well.\nNow looking at each season from 2008 to 2023, you can easily say who the worst teams are by just looking at the records from the seasons.

You can also see where the 2008 Lions are, and you might also be able to see that the 0-16 Lions had a below average offense but it’s not the worst. However, it was their defense that held them back. Detroit had a -9.1 defensive simple rating in 2008. To add to the sadness, the Lions defense didn’t get any better the year after. In 2009, Detroit boasted a -9.2 defensive simple rating. However, their defense allowed less points in 2009, compared to 2008.\n\n\nCode\ndetroit &lt;- NFL08_23 |&gt; filter(Team==\"2008 Detroit Lions\")\ndetroit2 &lt;- NFL08_23 |&gt; filter(Team==\"2009 Detroit Lions\")\ncleveland &lt;- NFL08_23 |&gt; filter(Team==\"2017 Cleveland Browns\")\nstlouis &lt;- NFL08_23 |&gt; filter(Team==\"2009 St. Louis Rams\")\nkansascity &lt;- NFL08_23 |&gt; filter(Team==\"2012 Kansas City Chiefs\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=NFL08_23, aes(x=OSRS, y=DSRS), color = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=detroit, aes(x=OSRS, y=DSRS), color=\"#0076B6\") +\n  geom_point(data=cleveland, aes(x=OSRS, y=DSRS), color= \"#FF3C00\") +\n  geom_point(data=stlouis, aes(x=OSRS, y=DSRS), color= \"#95774C\") +\n  geom_point(data=kansascity, aes(x=OSRS, y=DSRS), color= \"#E31837\") +\n  geom_point(data=detroit2, aes(x=OSRS, y=DSRS), color=\"#0076B6\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=detroit, aes(x=OSRS, y=DSRS, label=\"2008 Lions\"), size=3) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=cleveland, aes(x=OSRS, y=DSRS, label=\"2017 Browns\"), size=3) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=stlouis, aes(x=OSRS, y=DSRS, label=\"2009 Rams\"), size=3) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=kansascity, aes(x=OSRS, y=DSRS, label=\"2012 Chiefs\"), size=3) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=detroit2, aes(x=OSRS, y=DSRS, label=\"2009 Lions\"), size=3) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.000390625, color=\"darkblue\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = -0.002929687, color=\"darkblue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=-7.5, y=7.5, label=\"Good defense, bad offense\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=10, y=-7.5, label=\"Good offense, bad defense\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Offensive Simple Rating\",\n    y = \"Defensive Simple Rating\",\n    title = \"Lions have two of the worst defenses and offenses\",\n    subtitle = \"Both 0-16 teams in NFL history were horrible but neither are the worst in both offensive and defensive rating.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro-football-reference.com | By Dylan Jurgens\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetroit had two of the worst offenses and defenses for the era. Like mentioned before, the 2009 Lions, who went 2-14, were statistically worse than the 0-16 Lions from the year before. What made these teams bad were their defenses but the offenses weren’t any better. The 2017 Browns were not statistically as bad as both of those teams, with a better defensive rating. However, Cleveland’s offense was pretty bad. You think the 0-16 Browns’ offense was bad, the 2009 Rams offense was off the charts bad.\n\n\nCode\nbadteams &lt;- c(\"2008 St. Louis Rams\", \"2009 Detroit Lions\", \"2009 St. Louis Rams\", \"2012 Kansas City Chiefs\", \"2020 New York Jets\", \"2010 Carolina Panthers\", \"2011 Tampa Bay Buccaneers\", \"2018 Arizona Cardinals\", \"2017 Cleveland Browns\")\n\nBadteams &lt;- NFL08_23 |&gt;\n  filter(Team %in% badteams)\n  \ndetroit &lt;- NFL08_23 |&gt; filter(Team == \"2008 Detroit Lions\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=NFL08_23,\n    aes(x=Season, y=SRS),\n    color=\"grey\"\n  ) +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=detroit,\n    aes(x=Season, y=SRS),\n    color=\"#0076B6\"\n  ) +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=Badteams,\n    aes(x=Season, y=SRS),\n    color=\"red\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=detroit,\n    aes(x=Season, y=SRS, label=\"2008 Lions\"),\n    size=3\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=Badteams,\n    aes(x=Season, y=SRS, label=Team),\n    size=2.5\n  ) +\n  labs(x=\"Season\", y=\"Simple rating\", title=\"2008 Lions don't have the worst simple rating for the era\", subtitle=\"The 0-16 Lions didn't have the worst simple rating, not only in 2008 but through 2009-2012\", caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Dylan Jurgens\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, when comparing the two 0-16 teams in the history of the NFL, the 2008 Lions clear the 2017 Browns. However, it’s clear that both teams weren’t even the worst teams in this era of the NFL. Since 2021, NFL teams have played 17 games per regular season. It makes you wonder, will we ever see a 0-17 team. Time will tell, but for now, there have only been two 0-16 teams among the other completely horrific season preformances."
